# Basic Calculator with Tkinter

This project is a simple calculator application built using Python's `tkinter` library. The goal is to demonstrate how to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for performing basic arithmetic operations.

## About the Project

The calculator will have a clean and user-friendly interface, allowing users to perform operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project is suitable for beginners looking to learn how to use `tkinter` to build desktop applications.

## Basic Operations of Tkinter

`Tkinter` is Python's standard library for creating GUI applications. Below are some of the core components and operations used in this project:

1. **Creating the Main Window**
   - The `Tk()` class is used to create the main application window.
   - Example:
     ```python
     from tkinter import Tk
     root = Tk()
     root.title("Basic Calculator")
     root.mainloop()
     ```

2. **Adding Widgets**
   - Widgets are the building blocks of a Tkinter application.
   - Common widgets used in this project include:
     - `Label`: To display text or instructions.
     - `Entry`: For user input.
     - `Button`: For interactive elements.

3. **Using Layout Managers**
   - `Tkinter` provides layout managers to arrange widgets in the window:
     - `pack()`: Places widgets in a block.
     - `grid()`: Places widgets in a table-like structure.
     - `place()`: Places widgets at an absolute position.

4. **Handling Events**
   - Button clicks and other user actions are handled using event binding.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def on_button_click():
         print("Button clicked!")

     button = Button(root, text="Click Me", command=on_button_click)
     button.pack()
     ```

5. **Configuring Widgets**
   - Widgets can be customized using properties like `text`, `font`, `bg` (background), and `fg` (foreground).

6. **Running the Main Event Loop**
   - The `mainloop()` method starts the Tkinter application and waits for user interaction.

## How to Run the Project
